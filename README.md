# PointlessBot
This is basically just BasicBot by Habchy with some commands added glued to a slightly modified version of Music by YetiGuy
I modified music by making it so you could change the volume when a song isn't playing and the volume level between songs is consistent.
This bot was meant as just a novelty thing to slap on my friend's discord server, but if you want to add it to your server you can use this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=434377763827482644&scope=bot&permissions=8
